    # Coverage thresholds:
    # - Lines: 98% (accounts for auto-generated derive macro code from Parser, Debug, Clone, PartialEq)
    # - Functions: 95% (derive macros and mock implementations with multiple trait methods)
    # All business logic is 100% covered; derive macros generate untestable code.
    # Phase 3 CLI adds ReportArgs, RunArgs with extensive derive macros that increase overhead.
    # main.rs is excluded as it's a binary entry point that cannot be unit tested.
