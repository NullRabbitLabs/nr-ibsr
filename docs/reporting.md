# Offline Reporting

IBSR generates **offline reports** from traffic snapshots collected on a target host.
There is no live analysis, no dashboard, and no real-time decision-making.

## Status & Scope

IBSR reporting is **early-stage**.

It is currently intended for:
- controlled pilots
- evaluation and safety testing
- validating whether inline enforcement *could* be safe

The reporting pipeline, outputs, and responsibilities may change as the system evolves.
IBSR should not be relied on for protection.

## Overview

The reporting pipeline is intentionally **offline and unattended**.

Two reporting workflows are supported. For pilots, **vendor-generated reporting is the default**.

At no point are humans expected to monitor live output.

## Reporting Responsibility

### Vendor-Generated Reporting (Pilot Default)

In the default pilot setup:

1. The customer runs the IBSR collector on their infrastructure
2. Raw snapshot files (`.jsonl`) are uploaded to a customer-owned S3 bucket
3. Reports are generated by NullRabbit under agreement
4. Final report artefacts are returned to the customer

In this model:
- Customers do **not** run `ibsr-report`
- Customers do **not** tune thresholds
- Customers do **not** interpret results
- The collector runs unattended once configured

### Customer-Generated Reporting (Optional)

Customers may choose to generate reports themselves using `ibsr-report`.

This workflow is optional and intended for advanced users.
It is **not required** for pilot participation.

## Snapshot Collection

The IBSR collector writes traffic snapshots as `.jsonl` files.

Snapshots may be:
- uploaded directly from the collector host, or
- transferred to another system before upload

Example transfer:

```bash
rsync -avz user@collector:/var/lib/ibsr/snapshots/ ./snapshots/
```

## Uploading Snapshots

See [S3 Upload](s3-upload.md) for installation and usage of `ibsr-export`.

## Unattended Execution

IBSR is designed to run unattended once configured.

A typical pilot deployment:
- the collector runs continuously
- uploads occur on a schedule
- failures are treated as failed jobs, not live incidents

There are no dashboards to watch and no logs to tail.

## What IBSR Does Not Require

- live monitoring
- dashboards
- alerting
- manual inspection during runtime

IBSR produces artefacts.
Those artefacts are the interface.
