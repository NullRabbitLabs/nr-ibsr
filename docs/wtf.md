# WTF....

...Is a kernel-level shadow-mode security validation system for network traffic.

Seriously. What is going on in your mind right now, reading that. It's borderline nonsense. Copy that's straight out of a conversation between a school child and a mad scientist. 

In fact, reading most of the copy on these pages, you will, inevitably, find yourself going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole, wondering about your life choices, your pension maybe.

Who writes this. You look at the code and wonder what's going on too. You really have to question your life choices.

That's also what I'm wondering here too. I wrote it, me - Simon - and my friends Claude Code, Codex, gemini. We didn't really vibe - can anyone seriously VIBE when they're using nVIM? Well, I can and I'm ok with that. 

## But

This has a serious purpose and, you won't find many other people writing kernel level "shit" that has a 3% chance of successfully changing the world. 

Alas, 3% is more than 0% so I am giving it a shot. I don't need to invent an anti gravity machine, just trying over here to do something for the greater good of humankind, because before long, some seriously bad shit will probably happen and I bet none of you will shout:

*We should have installed IBSR!*

Which, arguably, does sound like IBS, pirate style. IBS rrrrrrrr, if you need clarification.

So here we are. Install it, see what happens. Make a change - drop me a line.
